            <p>
              The Shiba Inu community (ShibArmy) initiative started from a few
              to a record breaking of millions of supporters worldwide. From an
              individual or network of individuals dedicated to showcasing the
              energy, ecosystem, and power of cryptocurrencies, especially
              focused on the Shiba Ecosystem utility functions and growth factor
              in the DeFi space. With this being said, the health and well-being
              of the project has always been the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to award community initiatives with attention and support,
              but always with the understanding that each project holds value on
              its own and remind all community members to do research prior to
              engaging in any valued community commitment. We are proud to see
              Shiba Inu grow, as a community, as it should be, decentralized,
              and efficient.
